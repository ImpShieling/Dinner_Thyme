    "string": "Hi, my name is Rick, and I am the owner of Dinner Thyme. I have spent over twenty-plus years as the owner and operator of several eateries, and even I find it difficult to make time to create quality home-cooked dinners. The last thing I wanted to do after a long day’s work was to spend my limited free time shopping and chopping, instead of spending it with my family.\n\nIn July of 2010 I launched “Clear Cut Meals” in New York City. In those days we made and delivered all of our meals out of a small kitchen in the Upper West Side. In case you are wondering, yes, that makes us the original \"cook at home\" meal delivery service! We were very fortunate to have a devoted customer base, and after four years serving thousands of happy customers we expanded beyond New York City with a new larger kitchen in the Bronx with the creation of Dinner Thyme. \n\nWe believe that everyone should should be able to make delicious home cooked meals on their own schedule. That is why every ChefCuts meal is made using carefully selected ingredients that are cut, portioned, and packaged by our expert chefs. Every ChefCuts meal is then flash frozen to preserve the taste, freshness, and nutritional content of the ingredients. Lastly, we test every recipe to ensure that they can be made in under 20 minutes after defrosting. \n"
